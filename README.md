# Incandescence-2020

 Incandescence’2020, the annual cultural festival of NIT Silchar stands apart for being the most vibrant, enthusiastic and energetic event in the Northeast. From beautiful poetry read by eminent poets from across the country in ‘Kavi Sammelan’, to wild and energetic rock performances in ‘Thundermarch’, Incandescence has had it all over the years. It has evolved as the motivator for many with ‘Carpe Diem’, the night where established stars take the stage, and as a platform to grow and improve on your interpersonal skills with NITS MUN 2020.

Healthy competition is encouraged in Incandescence in the form of dance, music, drama, and literary competitions, such as ‘Sokratik’, the quiz module; and ‘The Thespian Rhapsody’, which includes acting and film making competitions. Prom night gives you an opportunity to chill amongst the excitement with your ‘one’  and enjoy a romantic evening on Valentine’s Day, and ‘V-Warz’ lets you form a team with your best buds and get your heart pumping in titles such as CS:GO, PUBG and FIFA.

As a youth festival, our responsibility towards the society is not forgotten and is fulfilled by organizing street plays, blood donation camps, ‘Gyansagar’ programmes which help the poorer children, and steering the younger generation in the right direction through ‘Razzmatazz’.
Incandescence has a tradition of crafting excellence. Participation from numerous colleges and the perseverance to be greater than we were before gives rise to the cultural extravaganza that is Incandescence 2020.
